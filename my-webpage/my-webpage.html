                        Rome has a museum dedicated entirely to pasta.
                        The first ever shopping mall was built in Rome between 107 and 110 AD by Emperor Trajan.
                        It sold a wide variety of goods and grocery items.
                        Rome's first university, La Sapienza, established in 1303 AD, is the largest in Europe and the second largest in the world.
