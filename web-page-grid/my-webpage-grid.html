                            The District Six Museum Foundation was only established in 1989, and the museum itself came into being in 1994.
                            The museum came into being as a vehicle for advocating social justice.

                            Nelson Mandela made his first free speech from a balcony at the Cape Town City Hall in 1990. 
                            The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world. The honey-coloured stone, which makes up its fa√ßade of limestone, was imported from Bath in England.

                            The first stone was laid on 2 January 1666 and it was completed by April 1679.. 
                            The materials used to build the Castle were local and included rock cut from the granite outcrop on Signal Hill, and blue slate and shells - transported from Robben Island.
